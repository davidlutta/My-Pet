    <h1>This is my favourite Pet </h1>
      <p>It is called a husky dog</p>
      <p>Here is a list of some of the things it likes playing with :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tennis balls</li>
        <li>Shoes</li>
        <li>Sweaters</li>
        <li>Pillows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And here is a list of some of the things it does not like :</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Visitors</li>
        <li>Cats</li>
        <li>Stale meat</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So yeah it really does not like visitors in fact we have to lock it in the the kennel so that we can have a party sad but if we did not do,
      someone could get seriously injured. It has a really nasty Bite !</p>
